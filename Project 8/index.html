            <div class="inner1" id="b2"><b>1.Raigad Fort</b><br>
                Raigad Fort is one of the most important forts in the history of Marathas, being
                the first capital of independent Marathi kingdom or “Hindavi Swarajya”. Graded as the most secured and
                most appropriate location by the King himself, the fort stands proudly showing the strength of the
                Maratha Empire. Raigad fort is situated 25 km north of the modern day Mahad town. Being situated
                comparatively near to the sea, with Mahad being in reach, and at same distance from Mumbai, Pune and
                Satara, Raigad enjoyed a strategic position. Moreover, it is an important link between the Deccan
                plateau and the coastal Maharashtra.
                Raigad is well surrounded by mountains and was considered secured. The fort is surrounded on its north
                and east by Kaal River, and Gandhari River flows from its west side. Fort Lingana is situated to the
                east side and Kokandiva to the north. If the skies are clear, we can see Rajgad-Torna on the east and
                Pratapgad, Vasota and Makarandagad on the south.

                Raigad was known as the mountain of “Rairi” before it was captured by Shivaji Maharaj. Due to its
                impregnability, Raigad was known as “Gibraltar of East”. In the 16th century, when this was not
                developed as a fort, it was called by local people as “Rashivata” and “Tanas”. Due to its shape of a
                tall oil lamp tower, it was also called as “Nandadeep”. The fort was called by 15 different names by
                different people at different times – Raigad, Rairi, Islamgad, Nandadeep, Jambudweep, Tanas, Rashivata,
                Badenur, Raigiri, Rajgiri, Bhivgad, Reddi, Shivlanka, Rahir and Gibraltar of the east. The fort was
                initially used to keep prisoners during the Nizamshahi rule. It was then ruled by the More clan of the
                Javli region. On 6th April 1656, Shivaji Maharaj besieged Rairi and captured it in May. The then
                Subhedar of Kalyan was transporting the treasure of Adilshah to Bijapur, which was raided by Marathas
                and utilized to fortify Raigad. It is mentioned in “Sabhasad Bakhar” how Shivaji Maharaj selected the
                fort as the first capital..</div>

            <div class="inner1" id="b2"><b> 2.Daulatabad Fort</b><br>
                This fort was built by the Yadava dynasty in 1187 and was known as Deogiri. When
                Muhammad Tughlak ascended the Delhi throne, he was so taken by the fortress that he decided to move his
                court and capital there, renaming it Daulatabad, "the City of Fortune". He ordered the entire population
                of Delhi to move out en masse to the new capital. Some of the prominent structures within the fort
                complex include the Mahakot which comprises four distinct lines of walls with 54 bastions that surround
                the fort for a length of nearly 5 kilometres. The walls are between 6 to 9 feet thick and 18 to 27 feet
                high with ammunition depots and granaries built along the interiors. Another interesting spot is the
                Hathi Haud a gigantic water tank admeasuring 38 x 38 x 6.6 meters with a capacity of about 10,000 cubic
                meters.A 5 kilometer strong wall, artificial scarping and a complicated series of defenses made
                Daulatabad Fort secure. The 30 meter high Chand Minar (Tower) built much later with 3 circular balconies
                played a defensive and religious role in the Fortress. </div>

                Murud-Janjira Fort is situated on an oval-shaped rock off the Arabian Sea coast
                near the port city of Murud, 165 km (103 mi) south of Mumbai. Janjira is considered one of the strongest
                coastal forts in India. The fort is approached by sailboats from Rajapuri jetty.
                Janjira from the outside

                The main gate of the fort faces Rajapuri on the shore and can be seen only when one is about 40 feet (12
                m) away from it. It has a small postern gate towards the open sea for escape.
                Entry Gate into Murud Janjira Fort. Accessible by ferry.

                The fort has 26 artillery towers still intact. There are many cannons of native and European make
                rusting on the towers. Now in ruins, the fort in its heyday was a full-fledged living fort with all the
                necessary facilities, e.g.,Barracks, quarters for officers, mosque, two small 60-foot-deep (18 m) fresh
                water ponds etc.[8] On the outer wall flanking the main gate, there is a sculpture depicting a
                tiger-like beast clasping elephants in its claws.
                The sculpture on the main gate

                The palace of the Nawabs of Janjira at Murud is still in good shape.[citation needed]

                A special attraction of this fort are 3 gigantic cannons named Kalalbangdi, Chavri and Landa Kasam.
                These cannons were said to be feared for their shooting range.[9] Another gate to the west is
                sea-facing, called 'Darya Darwaza'.

                There is also another fortress, named Ghosalgad, which is located on top of the hill around 32 km (20
                mi) east of Murud-Janjira, that was used as outpost for the rulers of Janjira.[10] </div>

                few more. Twelve forts were kept with Shivaji Maharaj after the treaty of Purander, Shivaji Maharaj kept
                Korigad Fort with him which proves the importance of this fort. March 11th, 1818, Col Prothar attacked

                periods of time: Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, Bahamanis, Nizams, Mughals and Marathas.
                Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured it in 1648 AD, but he was forced to surrender it to the Mughals in
                1665 AD by the Treaty of Purandar. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj recaptured the fort in 1670 AD and used it
                for keeping his treasury. This fort was used to keep the loot from Surat. Later in Peshwa time Nana
                Phadnavis used this fort for living for some time and built several structures in the fort such as a big
                tank and a step-well. </div>

                Shaniwar Wada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune, India.

                Built in 1732,[1] it was the great seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818. Following the
                rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century.[2]

                The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are

            <div class="inner1" id="b2"><b>9.Sindhudurg Fort</b><br>
                Built by Shivaji, Sindhudurg Fort was the naval headquarters of the Marathas.
                Situated on Kurte Island, it lies half a km away from the Malvan Port in the Arabian Sea. The fort lies
                130 km north of Goa.

                Shivaji built the fort area to safeguard the maritime borders of his kingdom and from neighbouring
                rulers. The foundations of the fort were strengthened by using molten lead mixed with mortar. More than
                70,000 kilos of iron was used for casting its foundation.

                The construction of the fort began in 1664 and took three years to complete. About 100 Portuguese
                architects, who were specially invited from Goa along with a strong workforce unit of 3000, were
                deployed for its construction. It is believed that the great warrior king himself lent a hand in
                building the fort.

                Sindhudurg is spread over 48 acres with the fortified walls, 29 ft high and 12 ft thick, stretch for two
                miles. As many as 52 bastions with embrasures for cannons guard its walls. Some bastions have secret
                exits that lead out of the fort.

                One can enter the fort through the Dilli Darwaja – the main gate. Because of its architectural design,
                the gate is visible only from close quarters and seems as if part of the walls. It is believed that
                Shivaji was very satisfied with the outcome of the fort. On the request of the fort architect, a
                handprint and a footprint of the Maratha King is embedded on a slab within the fort.

                Along with the customary shrines of Hanuman, Jarimari and Goddess Bhavani, the fort is most famous for
                the temple dedicated to Shivaji. Apart from the temples, a few tanks and three sweet water wells are
                also present in the fort area.

                Shivaji Jayanti, Ram Navami, Janmashtami, Mahashivratri and Ganesh Chaturthi are some of the prominent
                festivals that are celebrated in Sindhudurg on a grand scale.</div>
